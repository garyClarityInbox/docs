## 📝 Train Clarity in your voice

Clarity now learns your tone and style. You can guide it in **Dashboard → Train → Guidance**.

## 👥 Smarter CC / BCC rules

Tired of looping in the same teammates? Clarity can now handle that automatically, so you never miss the right people on a thread.

## 📇 Contacts that remember everything

Clarity understands your relationships. In **Dashboard → Train → Contacts**, click a contact to see:

- Drafted replies fine-tuned to that specific person

## 💰 Qualify inbound leads

If you’re getting a flood of inbound leads from sign-up forms & lead magnets, Clarity helps qualify and convert them so you don’t leave revenue on the table.

## 🏷️ Labels Rule (coming soon)

You’ll soon be able to teach Clarity to auto-label emails. Great for decluttering spam or resurfacing special project threads.
