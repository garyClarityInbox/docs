## Real World Use Cases

### Use Case #1: Keeping Answers Accurate with FAQs

**Challenge:** Support teams often get the same questions over and over. Without a shared, up-to-date FAQ, answers can drift apart and become outdated or inconsistent.

**Solution:** Add common questions and approved responses to Clarity as knowledge items. Team members can review, update, and expand these answers as things change.

**Result:** Clarity can quickly respond to repeated questions using the latest, most accurate information. Everyone on the team gives consistent answers, saving time and ensuring customers get clear, reliable info.

### Use Case #2: Responding to Coffee Meeting Requests

**Challenge:** Getting invited for coffee meetups happens often, but it can be time-consuming to reply each time—especially when you want to either accept or politely decline based on your schedule.

**Solution:** Add a knowledge item with options for both situations: one where you accept and automatically share your Calendly link to book a time, and another where you decline in a friendly, professional way (“I’m busy with work right now, but what would you like to discuss?”).

**Result:** Clarity makes it easy to send quick, appropriate responses every time, saving you effort while keeping your replies professional.
