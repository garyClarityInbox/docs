## Overview 

**Automate team communication by teaching ClarityInbox when to CC or BCC specific addresses.** Ensure the right people are always included (or discreetly notified) in your workflows, reducing manual errors and missed handoffs.

## Why Use This Feature

- **Never forget a teammate:** Automatically CC collaborators for key conversations (e.g., investors, partners, support)
- **Save time with workflows:** Eliminate repetitive CC email address that send emails to applications
- **Streamline compliance:** Ensure sensitive recipients are BCC’d, maintaining privacy and audit trails



## How to Set Up CC & BCC Rules

  2. Clarity can also scan if the email subject line contains a keyword, and can add an email address to the BCC header.


## Advanced Playbooks

Set up CC/BCC rules for complex scenarios:

- **Compliance workflows:** CC legal and BCC finance when subject contains "contract" or "NDA"
- **VIP customer support:** CC account manager and BCC support for emails from VIP customers
- **Family coordination:** BCC family for emails with "Moving Company" in subject
- **Board reporting:** CC management and BCC board observers for "board update" topics
- **Incident escalation:** CC engineering, BCC security for emails tagged "urgent" or "outage"



## Real World Use Cases

### Use Case #1: Investor Updates

**Challenge:** Alex wants all investor updates to CC his partner and BCC the finance team for records.

**Setup:** Add partner's email to CC, finance team to BCC. Trigger if subject contains "investor" or "update".

**Result:** Every relevant message includes the right team automatically, saving Alex multiple steps per email.

### Use Case #2: Support Escalation

**Challenge:** Support needs to CC the engineering lead if an email contains "urgent" or "bug report".

**Setup:** CC engineering lead for messages with "urgent" in subject; BCC success manager for follow-up.

**Result:** Streamlined escalation process, fewer missed issues.

### Use Case #3: Family Coordination

**Challenge:** Jordan is coordinating an upcoming move and wants to make sure their sister, Angela, is always updated on any communications about the moving company.

**Setup:** Create a BCC rule where any email with "Moving Company" in the subject line will automatically BCC Angela (Angela@family.com). Add a context to clarify: “Any email about the moving company, cc my sister.”

**Result:** Angela automatically receives all move-related emails without Jordan having to remember to manually BCC her each time, ensuring seamless family coordination and no missed details.
