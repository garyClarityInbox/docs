## Why Use This Feature

- **Never forget a teammate:** Automatically CC collaborators for key conversations (e.g., investors, partners, support)
- **Save time with workflows:** Eliminate repetitive CC email address that send emails to applications
- **Streamline compliance:** Ensure sensitive recipients are BCC’d, maintaining privacy and audit trails
