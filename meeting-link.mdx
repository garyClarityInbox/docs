- Keywords in the conversation thread

## Why Use This Feature

- **Eliminate repetitive tasks**: No more searching for and copying calendar links
- **Maintain consistency**: Always use the right calendar link for each situation

Set up different calendar links for different scenarios:

## Real World Use Cases

### Use Case #1: Sales Team Scenario

**Challenge**: Sarah, a sales manager, wastes 2 minutes per prospect manually finding and sharing her Calendly link.

**Solution**: After setup, when prospects ask to schedule a demo, ClarityInbox automatically suggests: _"I'd love to show you how this works! Here's my calendar to book a 30-minute demo: calendly.com/sarah/demo"_

**Result**: Sarah saves 2+ hours weekly and increases her response speed by 75%.

**Result**: Reduced scheduling confusion and improved customer experience.
