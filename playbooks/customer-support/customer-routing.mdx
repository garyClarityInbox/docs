## ‚ö°Ô∏è How it works

**Goal:** Ensure all support requests reach your support team without falling through cracks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    AI detects support language\*\* (bugs, billing, technical issues)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Labels as "Customer Support" and "SUPPORT"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    BCCs support team or help desk
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Archives from main inbox after routing
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üîÆ Real Example Scenario

Route support emails without losing threads outside your help desk.

_Sample Email:_\
"Hi, I'm having trouble with the Gmail integration‚Äîit keeps disconnecting."

ClarityInbox labels **"SUPPORT"**, auto-BCCs [support@intercom.io](mailto:support@intercom.io), and archives from main inbox.
