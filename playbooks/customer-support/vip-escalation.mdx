title: "🏆 VIP Escalation"
description: "Instantly flag and escalate urgent VIP emails to founders and leadership. Never lose a key account."

> _"I want to make sure my VIP customers are happy"_

### _Did you know?_

VIP customers account for up to 70% of revenue at B2B startups—92% leave after poor support.

## ⚡️ How it works

- **Goal:** VIP inbound communication is instantly flagged and escalated to founder/leadership immediately.
- **Identifies existing VIP customers, detects urgency**
- **AI labeling:** ("Exec Attention", "ACME Corp", "To Respond")
- **Auto-drafts priority response with VIP booking link**
- **CCs founders and leadership** (ex: [ceo@startup.com](mailto:ceo@startup.com), [head.sales@startup.com](mailto:head.sales@startup.com))

## 🔮 Real Example Scenario

Create automation that escalates VIP follow-ups to the leadership team.

VIP customer emails:\
_"We need this feature immediately."_

ClarityInbox labels it **"Exec Attention"** and drafts:

> "We can do that right away, I will set up time. CCing our CEO. [VIP Booking Link]"

Filed under “ACME corp” and “Exec Attention”.

## 📋 Copy and Paste This Setup

1. Visit the [Clarity Inbox Dashboard](https://app.clarityinbox.com/dashboard)
2. Create an AI Label named "Exec Attention"
3. Copy and paste this prompt below:

```c expandable
When email is from VIP account and contains urgency 
or urgent language ("asap", "immediate", "priority"), 
reply instantly: "We'll prioritize this right away—here's my calendar [vip-calendar-link]." 
CC: ceo@startup.com, head.sales@startup.com. 
File the email under the company’s label [company label], and “Exec Attention”.
```

<Accordion title="Advanced: Slack Alerts">
  **Alert the leadership team on Slack:**\
  Visit Zapier, create a new Zap:

  - Trigger: Gmail label "Exec Attention"
  - Action: Send the email info to your leadership Slack channel
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Future Enhancement">
  Track and report "time-to-fire-response" for all high value accounts.
</Accordion>
