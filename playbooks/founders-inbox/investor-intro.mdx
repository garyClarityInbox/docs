### _Did you know?_

**73% of successful funding rounds start with warm introductions rather than cold outreach.**

---

## ⚡️ How it works

- **Goal:** Keep your co-founder in the loop on every investor introduction for transparency and partnership.
- **AI detects investor introduction emails**
- **Auto-labels as "Investor Intro"**
- **CCs co-founder on reply**
- **Creates draft response thanking for intro**

## 🔮 Real Example Scenario

Create automation that keeps co-founders aligned on all investor conversations.

_Sample Email:_\
"Hi, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah from Acme Ventures who's interested in your space."

ClarityInbox drafts:

> "Thanks for the intro! Sarah, great to meet you—let's find time to chat about what we're building."

Auto-CCs: [cofounder@startup.com](mailto:cofounder@startup.com)

## 📋 Copy and Paste This Setup
