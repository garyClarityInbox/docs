## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How can I ensure my co-founder never misses an investor introduction?">
  This playbook auto-detects investor intro language, labels the email, CCs your co-founder, and drafts a polite response—so every warm lead is shared in real time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I receive multiple intros at once?">
  Emails matching the “Investor Intro” label are batched in your dashboard. You can review and send personalized replies in bulk, ensuring no intro is overlooked.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize who gets CC’d on intros?">
  Yes. The playbook template lets you list multiple stakeholders (co-founder, CEO, VP of Growth) in the CC line. Update the prompt to include any email addresses you choose.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I track and follow up on investor intros?">
  Integrate with Zapier to log each “Investor Intro” into a Notion or Airtable deal tracker. Automate follow-up reminders based on your preferred cadence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if an intro isn’t actually an investor?">
  Add negative keywords (e.g., “collab”, “partnership inquiry”) to your rule conditions so the AI only flags true investor introductions.
