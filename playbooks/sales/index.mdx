## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion title="How do I stop missing important follow-ups in my email?">
  ClarityInbox tracks replies and reminders automatically—so you’ll never forget a follow-up. When a reply hasn’t come in, the system proactively surfaces those emails and lets you send a quick automated (or personalized) nudge, ensuring your opportunities, deals, and client conversations are always moving forward.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I organize my overwhelming inbox for my small business?">
  ClarityInbox uses smart labels and automated categorization to identify sales, leads, support, and personal emails, filtering and archiving non-urgent messages. This keeps your inbox focused, organized, and stress-free, with founders seeing only the most important business messages first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the best way to manage leads without things falling through the cracks?">
  Automated labeling, follow-up alerts, and simple playbook workflows ensure every lead is tracked from first contact to close. High-intent leads are prioritized, referral and inbound opportunities are flagged, and integrated reminders make sure every prospect is engaged—so nothing goes missing, even during busy weeks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I automate email follow-ups without losing the personal touch?">
  With ClarityInbox, you can set up playbooks that draft personalized emails using customizable templates. Edit each draft before sending, automatically include colleague CCs, and adapt tone or details for each contact—so your automation stays authentic and doesn’t sound robotic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do my business emails get disorganized and how can I fix it?">
  Disorganization usually happens when inboxes are overloaded and lack categorization. ClarityInbox solves this by using AI-powered rules, smart folders, and custom playbooks to separate business from personal, sales from support, and automate routine tasks—transforming chaos into a streamlined, revenue-focused workspace.
