### _Did you know?_

**Qualified leads convert 4x higher and require 50% less nurturing time.**

---

## ⚡️ How it works

- **Goal:** Instantly qualify leads and enrich data before reply.
- **Lead magnet email notification comes in**
- **Extracts key info** (company, team size, need, questions) from email body
- **Creates tailored replies based on qualification**
- **Suggests next steps** based on qualifications (demo, ask, info packet)

## 🔮 Real Example Scenario

Automatically score leads so founders only spend time with accounts likely to close or grow. Saving hours weekly on manual filtering.

**High-value lead:** Form shows "Monthly Search Volume: \> 2,000+" → Labels "Qualified Lead" → Drafts: "Great! Let's set up a demo for tailored onboarding." CC sales team

**Smaller account:** Form shows "Monthly Search Volume: \< 2000" → Labels "Self Serve Lead" → Drafts: "Welcome! Here's our documentation to get you started."
