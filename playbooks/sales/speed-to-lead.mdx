### _Did you know?_ **Founders lose 78% of hot deals due to slow follow-up**

## How it works

- **Goal:** Ensure every inbound lead is prioritized and replied to within 2 minutes.
- **Identifies high qualified prospects**
- **AI labeling:** ("Hot Lead", "To Respond")
- **Automatically drafts personalized reply with booking link**
- **CCs sales team or stakeholder**

## Real Example Scenario

Create smart AI workflows that catch leads and respond quickly with alerts.

Dream prospect replies: "I am interested. Let's hop on a call."

ClarityInbox labels it "Hot Lead" and drafts a reply:

> "Thanks for reaching outâ€”here's my calendar for a demo today calendly.com/demo or prefer to call me 555-818-9292."

## Copy and Paste This Setup

1. Visit the [Clarity Inbox Dashboard](https://app.clarityinbox.com/dashboard)
2. Create an AI Label named "Hot Lead"
3. Copy and paste this prompt below:

```c expandable
If prospect replies positively and/or requests a demo,
reply with: "Thanks for reaching out! Here's my calendar: [booking link] or feel free to call me XXX-XXX-XXXX."
CC: sales@company.com
Label: "Hot Lead"
```
