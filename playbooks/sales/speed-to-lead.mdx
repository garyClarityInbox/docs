# ðŸš€ Speed to Lead Response Playbook

> "I wish I could have reply faster"
>
> _Did you know?_ **Founders lose 78% of hot deals due to slow follow-up** â€” [amplemarket]

## How it works

- **Goal:** Ensure every inbound lead is prioritized and replied to within 2 minutes.
- **Identifies high qualified prospects**
- **AI labeling:** ("Hot Lead", "To Respond")
- **Automatically drafts personalized reply with booking link**
- **CCs sales team or stakeholder**

## Real Example Scenario

Dream prospect replies:\
"I am interested. Let's hop on a call."

ClarityInbox labels it "Hot Lead" and drafts a reply:

> "Thanks for reaching outâ€”here's my calendar for a demo today [booking link] or prefer to call me XXX-XXX-XXXX."

Create smart AI workflows that catch leads and respond quickly with alerts.
