## Add Your Email Signature

ClarityInbox will automatically copy your email signature from your previous email account during setup, making it easy to keep a familiar sign-off without extra steps.

- Most users just want their usual name, title, and details—Clarity makes that simple.
- To review or change your signature, go to **Dashboard → Guidance → Signature**.

## Editing and Formatting

You can edit your signature anytime. Most standard text, links, and basic formatting are supported.  
Logos and images usually carry over, but image display can be inconsistent depending on the source—hosted images are more reliable than images copied from desktop apps.

- A small preview will show how your signature will appear before you save it.
- If an image doesn't show as expected, double-check the image’s link or try re-uploading it.

## Known Issues and Tips

- **Images:** Some email signatures use images hosted on platforms (like Google Drive) that may not display everywhere. For best results, use direct/publicly hosted image URLs.
- **Advanced layouts:** Email signature designs built with complex tables or external styles may not fully reproduce. Most simple signatures paste in cleanly.
- **Test email:** If you want to see what recipients will view, send yourself a test message after saving changes.

## Can I import a signature from Gmail or Outlook?

- Yes—copy and paste your signature from Gmail, Outlook, or another provider directly into the signature editor.
- Review the preview before saving to catch any layout issues.

## Need to turn off your signature?

You can always delete or clear your signature if you prefer.
