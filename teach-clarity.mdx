**Accelerate how ClarityInbox learns about your business so it can reply and organize your emails better.** Clarity uses past messages as well as your knowledge items to become a smart assistant.

**Share key info:** Onboard Clarity about your products, services, policies, or common business questions

**Consistent workflows:** These playbooks help everyone get consistent, up-to-date draft replies


## How to Add Knowledge Items 

⏱️ **Time required:** 2 minutes

2. Click Add Knowledge 
3. Fill out the Title 
4. Fill out the Description. 
5. Click Save.

## Advanced Playbooks

Ways to use knowledge items:

- **FAQs:** Add your usual customer questions with approved answers
- **Product details:** List key features or specifications to share in sales replies
- **Policies:** Add shipping, support, or legal information for reference
- **Templates:** Save standard responses for recurring topics (e.g., holiday hours, webinar invites)


## Real World Use Cases

### Use Case #1: Keeping Answers Accurate with FAQs

**Challenge:** Sales and support teams often get the same questions over and over. Without a shared, up-to-date FAQ, answers can drift apart and become outdated or inconsistent.

**Solution:** Provide common questions and approved responses to Clarity as knowledge items. Team members can review, update, and expand these answers as things change.

**Result:** Clarity can quickly respond to repeated questions using the latest, most accurate information while staying personalized. Everyone on the team gets consistent answers, saving time and ensuring customers get clear, reliable information.

### Use Case #2: Responding to Meeting Requests

**Challenge:** Getting invited for networking requests happens often, but instead of not replying and "ghosting", you can save time on drafting an accept or politely decline message.

**Solution:** Add a knowledge item with options for both situations: one where you accept and automatically share your Calendly link to book a time, and another where you decline in a friendly, professional way (“I’m busy with work right now, but what would you like to discuss?”).

**Result:** Clarity makes it easy to send quick, appropriate responses every time, saving you effort while keeping your brand and replies professional.
